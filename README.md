# Proportionate-Diversification-of-Top-k-LLM-Results-using-Database-Queries
Code base for my paper Proportionate Diversification of Top-k LLM Results using Database Queries. Find the paper here: https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3462/LLMDB1.pdf
## Important notice:
A MySQL database has to be created locally for the code to work. The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashirwadsangwan/imdb-dataset
Execute the code found in SQLops in MySQL before running the python script exp1.py. Follow the steps mentioned in section 3.1 and 3.2 for correct implementation.
Also openai api has to be installed locally prior to running the python script.
